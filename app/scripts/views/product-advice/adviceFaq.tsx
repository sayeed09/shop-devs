              It depends on your goal, your diet, calorie intake and physical
              activity. If you are planning to take this for weight loss, we
              highly recommend you connecting with our nutritionist post purchase

            If I don't exercise, can I still use this product?
            <div>
              You absolutely can - your body still benefits from nutrition. But we
              do recommend that you incorporate at least 30 minutes of daily
              physical activity.

              check with your gynaecologist once before starting with the product.

            <div>
              Aside from the fact that your body stops receiving it's dose of
              required nutrition, nothing bad really happens as long as you follow
              a balanced diet and lifestyle.
